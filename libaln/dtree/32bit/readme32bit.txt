      DTREE 1.4 (32bit) - SOURCE CODE
=======================================================================

This directory contains source code for the ALN Decision Tree (DTREE)
library for use with Microsoft Visual C++ v2.x, or with UNIX C compiler
variants. Other C compilers may also be used, but the makefiles may
need modification.

These files are compiled to form the DTREE 1.4 library.  The library
may be built in a number of configurations, depending upon operating 
system, memory usage or model, and whether or not debugging and 
diagnostic aids are to be included in applications which link with the
library.

Use a makefile to build a UNIX variant.  You may need to
modify the source files to change CRLF pairs to CR.
